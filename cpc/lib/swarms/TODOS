3. Prevent multiple calls to get_dihedrals --> Done, 30/7/12
5. Implement distances
6. Implement the iteration loop --> Done, 15/8/12
7. Ensure that all math in the reparamitrization script is valid modulo 180! --> Done, 30/7/12
8. Implement multiple chain support with restraints in .itp files --> include arrays for mdruns
9. Improve the organization of reparametrize.py
10. Allow all types of restraints to be used in swarms: angles, etc.
11. Eliminate the need for endstate structure. Only a point in colvars space is necessary. 
12. Compute collective variables drift within python.
