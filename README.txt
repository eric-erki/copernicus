Copernicus is a system that aims to take the scope of computer simulations from the level of individual simulation runs to one focused on obtaining results by  allowing the user to specify these end results rather than a detailed prescription of how to obtain them. It is then up to the Copernicus run-time system to break these desired end-results up into specific tasks and to run these tasks as efficiently as possible on the available computational resources.
