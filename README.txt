Copernicus is an open source platform that lets you automate problems that require more computing power than your single workstation provide. Using the platform you can consolidate you’re desktop machines, supercomputing cluster and cloud instances and use them all at once to solve distributed computing problems.
It was first developed with the support of ERC project 209825 and and is now continued in the Scalalife and Cresta projects.
