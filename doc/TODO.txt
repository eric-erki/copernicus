Dataflow:
[ - blocking and activating of functions ]
- cpcc graph output
- errors propagate up
- clearing errors
- python function logging
- remove items from queue upon cpcc rm
- Add any function errors to cpcc info

Workers:
- Signal handler for workers (so they can exit gracefully)
- Fix gmx executable
- CPU time accounting
- --join with host file

Server:
- client command cpcc command-failed should work
- Server still starts when ports are taken
- Heartbeat monitoring reports only one command per heartbeat time
